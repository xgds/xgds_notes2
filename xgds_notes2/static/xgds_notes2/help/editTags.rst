**Edit Tags** lets you add, delete, edit and organize tags.

Exploring Tags:
---------------

Tags are a key part of using the {{ settings.XGDS_NOTES_MONIKER }} to identify and search for data.  It is important to have
meaningful, well organized, uniquely named tags that you and your team agree upon.  Tags help prevent misspellings and differing abbreviations.
*Root tags* are tags that have no parent.

 * To check if a tag exists, start typing the tag in the input box that says 'Type to check tag'. If it does not exist, it will say 'Tag not found'.
 * To explore the tree, click the triangle on the left hand side to expand a tag and see its descendants
 * If others are editing tags at the same time, click the reload button on the upper left to reload the tags.

Adding Tags:
------------
 * Right click on the parent tag and choose *Add* from the popup menu
 * A popup will appear.  Enter an abbreviation, tag name and optional description and press *Save*
 * You will see the new tag nested under the parent tag
 * You cannot make multiple tags with the same name
 * To add a *Root tag*, click on the *+ Root Tag* button at the top and follow the same process.

Editing Tags:
-------------
 * Right click on the tag you wish to edit and choose *Edit* from the popup menu
 * A popup will appear with that tag loaded.  Modify the abbreviation, tag name and optional description and press *Save*
 * You will see the changes in the tree
 * You cannot make multiple tags with the same name
 * If this tag has been used, all references will now instead use the new information that you have edited

Deleting Tags:
--------------
 * Right click on the tag you wish to delete and select delete
 * If the tag has not been used it will be deleted.
 * If it has been used it cannot be deleted.  You may edit it to make it more useful, or contact xGDS staff for help.
 * If the tag has children, you must delete or reorganize the children before deleting the tag.

Reorganizing Tags:
------------------
The hierarchy (nesting) of tags allows you to search by a parent tag for all descendant tags.

 * Click on the tag you want to move
 * Drag it over the new tag you want to contain it
 * If that is a valid choice, you will see blue and green arrows and a checkmark. Release the mouse.
 * If that is an invalid choice, you will see a red circle with a slash through it
 * To turn a tag into a root tag, right click on it and select *Make Root*
